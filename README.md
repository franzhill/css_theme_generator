Generating themed css stylesheets with Java

CSS is too low level when you want to think the look and feel of your website in terms of "theme".
A theme would be a coherent set of CSS settings that "go well together". For example, mixing all sorts of fonts and non-complementary colours does not go well together and there's nothing that prevents us doing this in CSS. 

The aim of this project is to show how it is possible to build upon CSS and offer a higher level, more coherent approach to theming a webpage.

By defining the concept of "Painters", then stacking them up and combining them to form a the idea of "themes", 
we are presented with a powerful tool that achieves just that, and relegates CSS to generated machine code.

The code presented here is written in Java, but it could have been written in any other (Turing complete ;o)) language.
